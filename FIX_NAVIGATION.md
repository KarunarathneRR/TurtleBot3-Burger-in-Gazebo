# 🚨 CRITICAL FIX - RViz Navigation "Unknown" Issue

## ROOT CAUSE IDENTIFIED ✓
Your diagnostic shows:
- ✅ Nav2 is running (all nodes present)
- ❌ **Gazebo simulation is NOT running** (/scan, /cmd_vel, /odom missing)

## THE PROBLEM
You're running RViz and Nav2, but **forgot to start Gazebo with the robot**!

## THE SOLUTION - Run These 3 Commands in 3 Separate Terminals

### Terminal 1: Start Gazebo World
```bash
export TURTLEBOT3_MODEL=burger
source /opt/ros/jazzy/setup.bash
source /home/shrinath/RIS-TurtleBot3-Autonomous-Navigation/install/setup.bash
ros2 launch my_simulations maze_world.launch.py
```
**Wait for Gazebo window to open and robot to appear (~15 seconds)**

### Terminal 2: Start Nav2 Stack
```bash
export TURTLEBOT3_MODEL=burger
source /opt/ros/jazzy/setup.bash
source /home/shrinath/RIS-TurtleBot3-Autonomous-Navigation/install/setup.bash
ros2 launch my_simulations nav2_maze.launch.py
```
**Wait for nodes to initialize (~10 seconds)**

### Terminal 3: Start RViz with Config
```bash
export TURTLEBOT3_MODEL=burger
source /opt/ros/jazzy/setup.bash
source /home/shrinath/RIS-TurtleBot3-Autonomous-Navigation/install/setup.bash
rviz2 -d /home/shrinath/RIS-TurtleBot3-Autonomous-Navigation/config/nav2_default_view.rviz
```

---

## OR USE AUTOMATIC LAUNCHER (EASIER!)

### Option A: Comprehensive Launcher (Recommended)
```bash
cd /home/shrinath/RIS-TurtleBot3-Autonomous-Navigation
./scripts/launch_nav2_system.sh
```
This opens 4 windows automatically with proper timing and diagnostics.

### Option B: Quick Check Current Status
```bash
cd /home/shrinath/RIS-TurtleBot3-Autonomous-Navigation
./scripts/check_nav2_status.sh
```
This tells you exactly what's running and what's missing.

## IN RVIZ - FOLLOW THESE STEPS EXACTLY

### Step 1: Verify Fixed Frame
- Top left, "Global Options" → "Fixed Frame" → select **"map"**

### Step 2: Give Initial Pose (CRITICAL!)
1. Click the **"2D Pose Estimate"** button (toolbar)
2. Click on the map near the center (where robot spawns: 0,0)
3. Drag to set initial orientation
4. Release mouse

**Why?** AMCL needs to know roughly where the robot is to start localizing.

### Step 3: Wait for Localization
- You should see green arrows (AMCL particle cloud) appear around the robot
- Wait 5-10 seconds for particles to converge
- Navigation panel should change from "unknown" to:
  - **Navigation: Ready**
  - **Localization: Converged**

### Step 4: Set Navigation Goal
1. Click the **"Nav2 Goal"** button (green flag icon in toolbar)
2. Click anywhere on the white area of the map
3. You should see:
   - Green line (global plan)
   - Red line (local plan)
   - Robot starts moving
   - Navigation panel shows "Feedback: Navigating"

## VERIFICATION COMMANDS

Run in Terminal 4 to verify everything:

```bash
source /opt/ros/jazzy/setup.bash
source /home/shrinath/RIS-TurtleBot3-Autonomous-Navigation/install/setup.bash

# Should show 15+ nodes including amcl, planner_server, controller_server
ros2 node list

# Should show /scan, /cmd_vel, /odom, /map, /tf
ros2 topic list

# Should show laser scan data
ros2 topic echo /scan --once

# Should show ~10-30 Hz
ros2 topic hz /scan

# Should show map data
ros2 topic info /map

# Check TF tree
ros2 run tf2_tools view_frames
# This creates frames.pdf - should show: map -> odom -> base_footprint -> base_link
```

## TROUBLESHOOTING

### Issue: "Gazebo flickers badly"
**Solution:** Already fixed! The launch file uses `--headless-rendering` flag.

### Issue: "Robot passes through walls"
**Causes:**
1. LaserScan not working → Check `/scan` topic
2. Costmaps not updating → Check `/global_costmap/costmap` and `/local_costmap/costmap`
3. Controller too aggressive → Tune `config/nav2_params.yaml`

**Quick fix:**
```bash
# In RViz, add these displays to debug:
# - Map → Topic: /global_costmap/costmap
# - Map → Topic: /local_costmap/costmap
# You should see obstacles (walls) marked in red/blue
```

### Issue: "Nav2 Goal button does nothing"
**Causes:**
1. Nav2 nodes not running → Check Terminal 2 for errors
2. Initial pose not set → Use "2D Pose Estimate" first
3. Goal is on obstacle → Try different location

**Debug:**
```bash
# Check if bt_navigator is active
ros2 node info /bt_navigator

# Check if goal was received
ros2 topic echo /goal_pose

# Check for navigation errors
ros2 topic echo /diagnostics | grep -A 5 navigation
```

### Issue: "AMCL won't converge"
**Solutions:**
1. Give better initial pose estimate (click closer to actual robot position)
2. Drive robot around manually to help AMCL:
   ```bash
   # In a new terminal:
   ros2 run turtlebot3_teleop teleop_keyboard
   ```
3. Reduce particle count in `config/nav2_params.yaml` if running slowly

## SUCCESS CHECKLIST

Your system is working correctly when:
- [x] Gazebo shows maze with robot
- [x] `ros2 node list` shows 15+ nodes
- [x] `/scan` topic publishes at ~10-30 Hz
- [x] RViz shows map, robot model, and laser scans
- [x] Navigation 2 panel shows "Ready" and "Converged" (not "unknown")
- [x] Setting a goal makes robot move
- [x] Green path appears before robot moves
- [x] Robot smoothly navigates around walls
- [x] Robot stops at destination

## COMPLETE COMMAND SUMMARY

```bash
# Always start with these in EVERY terminal:
export TURTLEBOT3_MODEL=burger
source /opt/ros/jazzy/setup.bash
source /home/shrinath/RIS-TurtleBot3-Autonomous-Navigation/install/setup.bash

# Terminal 1 - Gazebo (run FIRST!)
ros2 launch my_simulations maze_world.launch.py

# Terminal 2 - Nav2 (wait 15 sec after Terminal 1)
ros2 launch my_simulations nav2_maze.launch.py

# Terminal 3 - RViz (wait 10 sec after Terminal 2)
rviz2 -d /home/shrinath/RIS-TurtleBot3-Autonomous-Navigation/config/nav2_default_view.rviz

# Terminal 4 - Diagnostics
./scripts/check_nav2_status.sh
```

---

## QUICK TEST AFTER SETUP

```bash
# 1. Check everything is running
ros2 node list | wc -l  # Should be 15+

# 2. Test LaserScan
ros2 topic hz /scan  # Should show ~10-30 Hz

# 3. Test AMCL
ros2 topic echo /amcl_pose --once

# 4. Send a simple navigation goal via command line
ros2 topic pub --once /goal_pose geometry_msgs/msg/PoseStamped "{
  header: {frame_id: 'map'},
  pose: {
    position: {x: 1.0, y: 1.0, z: 0.0},
    orientation: {x: 0.0, y: 0.0, z: 0.0, w: 1.0}
  }
}"

# Robot should start moving!
```

## 🎯 IF YOU FOLLOW THESE STEPS, YOUR ROBOT WILL NAVIGATE PERFECTLY!

The issue was simple: **You had Nav2 running but no simulation running.**
Now you know the complete, correct startup sequence!
